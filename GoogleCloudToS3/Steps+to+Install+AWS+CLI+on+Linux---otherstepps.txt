Check for aws in google cloud local, if its not installed do the following steps. We are doing this to install AWS client through which we can transfer our reports from local to S3

Step-1
### Download the Installation file using curl command.
curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"

Step-2
### Unzip the Installer.
unzip awscliv2.zip

Step-3
### Run the Install Program
sudo ./aws/install

Step-4
### Confirm the Installation
aws
aws --version


aws s3 ls s3://prescpipeline  --->prescpipeline is the S3 bucket created in Aws Console., and this is the command to access it from google cloud which require permissions so we need access key to access that bucket.

So we go to AWS to generate access keys through IAM--Identity and acess management
So go to IAM -> Add users > spark user > check the access keys programatic access > attach policy(eg administrator acess) > finally creaate user

after that we will get 2 keys 1. Access Key -AKIAR7VXZS5NCBS6UXT 2. Secret access key: 

next: create profile in google cloud: aws configure --profile myprofile
paste your access key id --enter
copy paste secret key access id-- enter
enter
enter

now do aws s3 --profile myprofile ls s3://prescpipeline  enter
if no error then we have successfully installed CLI client at our local google cloud server and able to access s3 bucket.

After all these steps, refer next note file copy_file_to_s3 and run it
